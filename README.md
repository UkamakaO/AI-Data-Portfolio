### Data/AI Projects
**A Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in the Internet of Medical Things.**
- This study leverages Machine Learning (ML) to enhance the security of medical IoT devices by identifying vulnerabilities at different operational states and understanding the types of attacks they are most susceptible to.
- [Project](https://github.com/UkamakaO/ML-Vulnerability-Assesment-for-IoMT)

**Responsible AI Research Project: Responsible AI (RAI) for Detecting Obfuscated Malware**
- The interest of my research was to foster acceptance and increase the widespread utilization of AI tools in fighting cybercrimes by contributing to the ongoing endeavours to provide insights into predictions of AI models.
- Publication ongoing.

**Predictive Data Analysis for Hotel Reservation**
- Predicting the revenue per room (average price per room) made or forfeited by the hotel given other customer reservation details including if there was a cancellation or not.
- [Project](https://github.com/UkamakaO/Predictive-Data-Analysis-on-Hotel-Reservation)
  
**Data Visualization for Global Video Game Sales**
- A tableau dashboard was created as an infographic tool to tell two stories for two research questions asked by a marketing manager of a games-producing company. The dashboard view was redesigned in Power BI for comparison of how I achieved the dashboard to answer the research questions using both methods (Tableau and Power BI).
